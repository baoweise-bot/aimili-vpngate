AimiliVPN uses Python's standard library to manage VPNGate nodes. It provides node discovery and testing, connection switching, a Web dashboard, and HTTP, HTTPS website proxying, and SOCKS5 access on one local port.

| Item | Default or supported range |
| --- | --- |
| Web dashboard | TCP `8787`, a private path, username, and password |
| Local proxy | `127.0.0.1:7928`, HTTP, HTTPS `CONNECT`, and SOCKS5 |
| Source deployment | x64, x86, ARM64, and ARM32 Linux |
| Docker images | `linux/amd64`, `linux/386`, `linux/arm64`, and `linux/arm/v7` |
| Update channel | GitHub `main` stable branch / latest stable Release |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Network availability:** Some regions, data centers, and network providers may restrict DNS, VPNGate APIs, GitHub mirrors, or VPN protocols. Mirrors and local snapshots improve node-list availability but cannot guarantee a successful connection on every host. Confirm that local law and your VPS provider permit VPN/TUN before deployment.

<a id="quick-install"></a>
## Quick Install

Run as `root` on a supported Linux VPS:

```bash
bash <(curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/baoweise-bot/aimili-vpngate/main/install.sh)
```

The installer prints the complete Web URL, private path, username, and password. Run `ml` to open the management menu.

> [!TIP]
> Enable TUN/TAP in the VPS control panel and verify that `/dev/net/tun` exists. The Web dashboard uses TCP `8787` by default; restrict firewall access to your own IP whenever possible.

Before purchasing, confirm that the selected plan permits TUN/TAP, OpenVPN, and the required network protocols. An affiliate link is not a guarantee that a specific plan will work.

<a id="installation"></a>
## Installation

### Requirements

- Ubuntu, Debian, Alpine, CentOS, RHEL, Rocky Linux, AlmaLinux, Fedora, Oracle Linux, or Amazon Linux.
- `root`, OpenVPN, iptables, policy routing, and TUN/TAP.
- Windows and macOS can be proxy clients, but cannot run the full gateway. Docker Desktop is not equivalent to a Linux VPS with host TUN access.

### Option 1: Source installer

```bash
bash <(curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/baoweise-bot/aimili-vpngate/main/install.sh)
```

The installer deploys to `/opt/aimilivpn` and registers a system service.

For unattended installation, explicitly skip the first-run prompts and generate the Web path and credentials automatically:

```bash
AIMILIVPN_NONINTERACTIVE=1 bash <(curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/baoweise-bot/aimili-vpngate/main/install.sh)
```

```bash
ml                 # Open the management menu
ml status          # Show status, Web URL, and username
ml logs            # Follow logs
ml restart         # Restart the service
ml password        # Reset Web credentials
ml update          # Update from the stable main branch
ml uninstall       # Uninstall
```

To inspect the installer first:

```bash
git clone --branch main --single-branch https://github.com/baoweise-bot/aimili-vpngate.git
cd aimili-vpngate
sudo bash install.sh
```

Universal Linux source archives and SHA-256 checksums are available from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/baoweise-bot/aimili-vpngate/releases/latest). Version changes are documented in the Release Notes.

### Option 2: Docker Compose

The Docker host must provide `/dev/net/tun`, host networking, `NET_ADMIN`, and `NET_RAW`.

```bash
git clone --branch main --single-branch https://github.com/baoweise-bot/aimili-vpngate.git
cd aimili-vpngate
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
docker logs -f aimilivpn
```

Image: `ghcr.io/baoweise-bot/aimili-vpngate:2.1`

Update:

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

```

</details>

<a id="connection"></a>
## Connection and Use

### 1. Sign in to the Web dashboard

For a source installation, open the URL printed by the installer:

```text
http://VPS_IP:8787/private_path/
```

Run `ml status` to recover the URL, or `ml password` to reset credentials.

Docker users can read the initial Web configuration with:

```bash
docker exec aimilivpn cat /data/ui_auth.json
```

Use its `secret_path`, `username`, and `password`, then change them after the first sign-in.

### 2. Fetch and connect to a node

1. Sign in and wait for the first node list, or select **Update nodes**.
2. Filter by country and use **Test** to measure reachability and latency from the VPS.
3. Select **Switch** on the target node. A failed target precheck should leave the current usable connection in place when possible.
4. Choose Smart Auto, Fixed Country, or Fixed IP routing.
5. Confirm the VPN state and outbound IP in the status area.

### 3. Use the proxy on the VPS

HTTP, HTTPS website proxying, and SOCKS5 share `127.0.0.1:7928`. HTTPS sites use the HTTP proxy's `CONNECT` method, so the proxy URL remains `http://127.0.0.1:7928`.

```bash
# HTTP / HTTPS
curl -x http://127.0.0.1:7928 https://api.ipify.org

# SOCKS5 with remote DNS resolution
curl --proxy socks5h://127.0.0.1:7928 https://api.ipify.org
```

### 4. Connect from another computer

The proxy listens on the VPS loopback address by default. Use an SSH tunnel instead of exposing it publicly:

```bash
ssh -N \
  -L 8787:127.0.0.1:8787 \
  -L 7928:127.0.0.1:7928 \
  root@VPS_IP
```

After the tunnel is established:

- Web: `http://127.0.0.1:8787/private_path/`
- HTTP / HTTPS proxy: `127.0.0.1:7928`
- SOCKS5 proxy: `127.0.0.1:7928`; enable remote DNS or `socks5h` when available

> [!WARNING]
> Port `7928` has no public-facing user authentication by default. Never expose it directly without a firewall, source-IP restriction, or another reliable access-control layer.
